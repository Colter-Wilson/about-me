  <header><h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello, my name is Colter Wilson, I am a 22 year old aspiring software developer using Windows 10 64-bit and student at CodeFellows. I'm currently living in Roanoke, Virginia where I work in the food industry at Franks Pizza. After graduating Patrick Henry High School in 2018 I attended Roanoke College for a year until I decided that I was going to drop out. After dropping out I worked many different jobs up until the point I discovered my passion for coding and made my decision to enroll in Code Fellows. In my free time I enjoy boxing and most physical activities in general.</p></header>
